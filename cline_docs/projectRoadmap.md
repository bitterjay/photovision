# PhotoVision - Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals

### Core Vision
- [ ] Build a conversational AI bridge between users and their SmugMug photo collections
- [ ] Enable natural language queries like "find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling" with Claude AI interpreting intent
- [ ] Transform photo discovery through intelligent conversation rather than traditional search interfaces
- [ ] Create a minimal, straightforward technical architecture without unnecessary frameworks

4. [x] Test: Process multiple images, handle failures gracefully

#### Phase 6: Conversational LLM Bridge
1. [x] Claude interprets natural language queries (e.g., \"find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling\")
2. [x] Function calling approach for structured database searches
3. [x] Conversational responses with photo results and SmugMug links
4. [x] Test: Natural language search queries work correctly with intelligent results

#### Phase 7: UI Modernization & Enhanced Search
1. [x] Duplicate data when batch processing
2. [x] Resize image to under 5mb and 2200px wide (if landscape) or 2200px tall (if portrait)
3. [x] Enhanced image layout with masonry design and full image display
4. [x] Modernize UI interface
   - [x] Implement tabbed interface for Chat, Batch Processing, and API Connections
   - [x] Add dark/light theme support with theme switcher
   - [x] Update iconography throughout the application
   - [x] Add lightbox functionality for images (change "View" to "Download")
5. [ ] Improve search algorithms and query understanding
6. [ ]Make chat responses sound more natural and human-like
7. [ ] Enable prompt customization for batch processing
8. [ ] Additional UI improvements and polish
9. [ ] Test: End-to-end user experience
10. allow users to add their own keywords
11. allow users to build their own albums
12. allow users to choose their own LLM to use

## Completion Criteria

- User authentication and multiple accounts
- Image similarity search using embeddings

### Infrastructure
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Database migration path from JSON to SQL
- API versioning strategy
- Monitoring and logging improvements
