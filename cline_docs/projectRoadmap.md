# PhotoVision - Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals

### Core Vision
- [ ] Build a conversational AI bridge between users and their SmugMug photo collections
- [ ] Enable natural language queries like "find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling" with Claude AI interpreting intent
- [ ] Transform photo discovery through intelligent conversation rather than traditional search interfaces
- [ ] Create a minimal, straightforward technical architecture without unnecessary frameworks

### Key Features

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Documentation Setup
1. [x] Create cline_docs structure with all required files
2. [x] Set up minimal project structure
3. [x] Create basic web interface (HTML/CSS/JS)
4. [x] Test: Serve static files, basic UI works

#### Phase 2: Core API Foundation
1. [x] Simple Node.js server with basic routing
2. [x] JSON file-based data storage system
3. [x] Basic error handling and logging
4. [x] Test: Server runs, basic endpoints respond

#### Phase 3: Image Analysis Pipeline
1. [x] Anthropic Claude API integration
2. [x] Single image analysis functionality
3. [x] Enhanced chat feedback system
4. [x] Keywords generation for indexing
5. [x] Stateless analysis (no database persistence)
6. [x] Test: Upload image, get analysis, display comprehensive results

#### Phase 4: SmugMug Integration
1. [x] SmugMug API authentication (OAuth 1.0a implementation)
2. [x] Fetch single album/image metadata
3. [x] Process one image from SmugMug
4. [x] Test: Connect to SmugMug, fetch and analyze one image

#### Phase 5: Batch Processing
1. [x] Queue system for multiple SmugMug images
2. [x] Progress tracking and status updates
3. [x] Error handling for failed analyses
4. [x] Test: Process multiple images, handle failures gracefully

#### Phase 6: Conversational LLM Bridge
1. [x] Claude interprets natural language queries (e.g., \"find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling\")
2. [x] Function calling approach for structured database searches
3. [x] Conversational responses with photo results and SmugMug links
4. [x] Test: Natural language search queries work correctly with intelligent results

#### Phase 7: Enhanced Search & Polish
1. [x] Enhanced image layout with masonry design and full image display
2. [ ] Improved search algorithms and query understanding
3. [ ] Better conversational responses and context awareness
4. [ ] Additional UI improvements and polish
5. [ ] Test: End-to-end user experience

## Completion Criteria

### MVP Success Metrics
- [ ] User can connect SmugMug account
- [ ] System can analyze and store descriptions for uploaded images
- [ ] User can search using natural language queries
- [ ] Results display correctly with SmugMug links
- [ ] Basic error handling for API failures
- [ ] Processing progress is visible to user

### Technical Completion Criteria
- [ ] All API integrations functional (SmugMug, Anthropic)
- [ ] Data persistence working (JSON-based storage)
- [ ] Web interface responsive and functional
- [ ] Test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] Documentation complete and up-to-date

## Future Scalability Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Consider migration from JSON files to SQLite for larger datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed image analyses
- Add rate limiting for API calls

### Enhanced Features
- Advanced search filters (date, location, people)
- Batch import optimization
- User authentication and multiple accounts
- Image similarity search using embeddings

### Infrastructure
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Database migration path from JSON to SQL
- API versioning strategy
- Monitoring and logging improvements

## Completed Tasks
