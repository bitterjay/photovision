# PhotoVision - Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals

### Core Vision
- [ ] Build a conversational image discovery platform for SmugMug photo collections
- [ ] Enable natural language search queries like "10 photos of young adults smiling"
- [ ] Transform traditional keyword search into intelligent, contextual discovery
- [ ] Create a minimal, straightforward technical architecture without unnecessary frameworks

### Key Features

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Documentation Setup
1. [x] Create cline_docs structure with all required files
2. [x] Set up minimal project structure
3. [x] Create basic web interface (HTML/CSS/JS)
4. [x] Test: Serve static files, basic UI works

#### Phase 2: Core API Foundation
1. [x] Simple Node.js server with basic routing
2. [x] JSON file-based data storage system
3. [x] Basic error handling and logging
4. [x] Test: Server runs, basic endpoints respond

#### Phase 3: Image Analysis Pipeline
1. [x] Anthropic Claude API integration
2. [x] Single image analysis functionality
3. [x] Enhanced chat feedback system
4. [x] Keywords generation for indexing
5. [x] Stateless analysis (no database persistence)
6. [x] Test: Upload image, get analysis, display comprehensive results

#### Phase 4: SmugMug Integration
1. [ ] SmugMug API authentication
2. [ ] Fetch single album/image metadata
3. [ ] Process one image from SmugMug
4. [ ] Test: Connect to SmugMug, fetch and analyze one image

#### Phase 5: Basic Search
1. [ ] Simple text search through stored analyses
2. [ ] Basic conversational interface
3. [ ] Return image results with SmugMug links
4. [ ] Test: Search works, results display correctly

#### Phase 6: Batch Processing
1. [ ] Queue system for multiple images
2. [ ] Progress tracking and status updates
3. [ ] Error handling for failed analyses
4. [ ] Test: Process multiple images, handle failures gracefully

#### Phase 7: Enhanced Search & Polish
1. [ ] Improved search algorithms
2. [ ] Better conversational responses
3. [ ] UI improvements and polish
4. [ ] Test: End-to-end user experience

## Completion Criteria

### MVP Success Metrics
- [ ] User can connect SmugMug account
- [ ] System can analyze and store descriptions for uploaded images
- [ ] User can search using natural language queries
- [ ] Results display correctly with SmugMug links
- [ ] Basic error handling for API failures
- [ ] Processing progress is visible to user

### Technical Completion Criteria
- [ ] All API integrations functional (SmugMug, Anthropic)
- [ ] Data persistence working (JSON-based storage)
- [ ] Web interface responsive and functional
- [ ] Test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] Documentation complete and up-to-date

## Future Scalability Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Consider migration from JSON files to SQLite for larger datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed image analyses
- Add rate limiting for API calls

### Enhanced Features
- Advanced search filters (date, location, people)
- Batch import optimization
- User authentication and multiple accounts
- Image similarity search using embeddings

### Infrastructure
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Database migration path from JSON to SQL
- API versioning strategy
- Monitoring and logging improvements

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation Phase
- [x] Project concept document created
- [x] Technical architecture planned
- [x] Implementation roadmap defined
- [x] cline_docs folder structure established

### Phase 1 - Foundation & Documentation Setup
- [x] Complete cline_docs structure with all required files
- [x] Basic project structure with package.json and server.js
- [x] Public folder with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- [x] Working web server serving static files
- [x] Basic chat interface with placeholder functionality

## Progress Tracker

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - SmugMug Integration
**Next Milestone**: SmugMug API authentication and integration
**Completed**: Phase 1, Phase 2, & Phase 3 - Foundation, Core API Foundation, & Enhanced Image Analysis Pipeline
**Last Updated**: Phase 3 completed with enhancements - Full image analysis pipeline with enhanced chat feedback, keywords generation, and stateless operation

### Phase 2 Completion Summary
- [x] Enhanced Node.js server with comprehensive API routing
- [x] JSON file-based data storage system with DataManager utility
- [x] Robust error handling and logging throughout application
- [x] All API endpoints tested and functional
- [x] Server successfully running on port 3000

## Notes

- Prioritizing minimal complexity and vanilla implementations
- Testing each feature immediately upon completion
- Maintaining detailed documentation throughout development
- Focus on core functionality before adding enhancements
