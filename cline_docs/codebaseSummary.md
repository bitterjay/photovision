## Data Flow

### Image Ingestion Flow
1. User connects SmugMug account via OAuth

3. Images queued for analysis processing
4. Anthropic Claude API analyzes each image
5. Generated descriptions stored in JSON files
6. Search index updated with new content

### Future Conversational Search Flow (Phase 6)
1. User enters natural language query in chat interface (e.g., "find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling")
2. Claude AI interprets user intent and extracts search parameters
3. Claude calls search functions with structured database queries
4. Search results retrieved from analyzed photo database
5. Claude formats conversational response with photo results
6. Frontend displays results with SmugMug links and contextual information

### API Communication Flow
```
Frontend (script.js) → Backend (server.js) → External APIs
                    ←                     ←
```
