6. Frontend displays results with SmugMug links

### API Communication Flow
```
Frontend (script.js) → Backend (server.js) → External APIs
                    ←                     ←
```

## Notes for Future Development

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Prioritize readable, simple code over optimization
- Add comments for complex logic and API interactions
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across all files
- Test each component individually before integration

### Scalability Considerations
- Design data structures for easy migration to database
- Keep API interfaces simple for future enhancement
- Plan for rate limiting and error handling from the start
- Document all external dependencies and their purposes

### Maintenance Strategy
- Regular documentation updates as features are implemented
- Monitor external API changes and update integrations accordingly
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
- Maintain clear development and deployment procedures
