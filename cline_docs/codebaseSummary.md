1. User enters natural language query in chat interface (e.g., "find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling")
2. Claude AI interprets user intent and extracts search parameters
3. Claude calls search functions with structured database queries
4. Search results retrieved from analyzed photo database
5. Claude formats conversational response with photo results
6. Frontend displays results with SmugMug links and contextual information

Frontend (script.js) → Backend (server.js) → External APIs
                    ←                     ←
```

## Notes for Future Development

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Prioritize readable, simple code over optimization
- Add comments for complex logic and API interactions
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across all files
- Test each component individually before integration

### Scalability Considerations
- Design data structures for easy migration to database
- Keep API interfaces simple for future enhancement
- Plan for rate limiting and error handling from the start
- Document all external dependencies and their purposes

### Maintenance Strategy
- Regular documentation updates as features are implemented
- Monitor external API changes and update integrations accordingly
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
- Maintain clear development and deployment procedures
