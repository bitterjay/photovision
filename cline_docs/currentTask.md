## Context

### Project Overview
PhotoVision is a conversational image discovery platform that transforms SmugMug photo collections into an intelligent, searchable archive using natural language queries. The project emphasizes minimal complexity with vanilla implementations over frameworks.

### Current State
- Phase 1 completed: Foundation & Documentation Setup
- Phase 2 completed: Core API Foundation
- Phase 3 completed: Image Analysis Pipeline with enhanced features
- Phase 4 completed: SmugMug Integration with full OAuth implementation
- Phase 5 completed: Batch Processing with JobQueue system and UI integration
- Complete cline_docs/ folder with all required documentation
- Working web interface with chat UI and comprehensive analysis feedback
- Server running successfully with full API integration including batch processing
- SmugMug client ready for authentication with valid API keys
- JobQueue system fully functional with progress tracking and error handling
- Ready to begin Phase 6: Conversational LLM Bridge functionality

### Technical Approach
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend
- Node.js with minimal dependencies for backend
- JSON files for initial data storage
- Direct API calls to Anthropic Claude for image analysis
- Direct API calls to SmugMug for photo ingestion

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 6: Conversational LLM Bridge)
1. **Claude interprets natural language queries**
   - Implement natural language query processing (e.g., "find 10 photos of girls ages 5-8 smiling")
   - Parse user intent and extract search parameters
   - Handle complex conversational queries

2. **Function calling approach for structured database searches**
   - Create search functions that Claude can call
   - Implement structured query generation from natural language
   - Connect conversational input to database operations

3. **Conversational responses with photo results and SmugMug links**
   - Format search results in conversational responses
   - Include photo details and SmugMug links
   - Provide contextual information about search results

4. **Test: Natural language search queries work correctly with intelligent results**
   - Verify natural language interpretation accuracy
   - Test complex query scenarios
   - Ensure intelligent and helpful responses

### Following Phase 6 (Phase 7 Preview - Enhanced Search & Polish)
1. Improved search algorithms and query understanding
2. Better conversational responses and context awareness
3. UI improvements and polish
4. Test: End-to-end user experience

## Technical Decisions Made
- **No frameworks policy**: Vanilla implementations only
- **File-based storage**: JSON files initially, avoid database complexity
- **Direct API calls**: No wrapper libraries for external services
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only add libraries when absolutely necessary
- **Test each feature**: Verify functionality before moving to next component

## Considerations
- Focus on getting basic structure working before adding complexity
- Prioritize testing and validation at each step
- Maintain documentation updates as development progresses
- Keep file structure as simple as possible initially
