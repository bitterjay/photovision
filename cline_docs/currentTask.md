## Context

### Project Overview
PhotoVision is a conversational image discovery platform that transforms SmugMug photo collections into an intelligent, searchable archive using natural language queries. The project emphasizes minimal complexity with vanilla implementations over frameworks.

### Current State
- Phase 1 completed: Foundation & Documentation Setup
- Phase 2 completed: Core API Foundation
- Phase 3 completed: Image Analysis Pipeline with enhanced features
- Phase 4 completed: SmugMug Integration with full OAuth implementation
- Phase 5 completed: Batch Processing with JobQueue system and UI integration
- Complete cline_docs/ folder with all required documentation
- Working web interface with chat UI and comprehensive analysis feedback
- Server running successfully with full API integration including batch processing
- SmugMug client ready for authentication with valid API keys
- JobQueue system fully functional with progress tracking and error handling
- Ready to begin Phase 6: Conversational LLM Bridge functionality

### Technical Approach
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend
- Node.js with minimal dependencies for backend
- JSON files for initial data storage
- Direct API calls to Anthropic Claude for image analysis
- Direct API calls to SmugMug for photo ingestion

## Next Steps

   - Responsive design with 3/2/1 column layout across devices

**Remaining Phase 7 Tasks:**
2. **Improved search algorithms and query understanding**
   - Enhanced search relevance and accuracy
   - Better handling of complex query scenarios
   - Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities

3. **Better conversational responses and context awareness**
   - More intelligent conversation flow
   - Enhanced context retention across queries
   - Improved result presentation and formatting

4. **Additional UI improvements and polish**
   - Performance optimizations
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Visual refinements and animations

5. **Test: End-to-end user experience**
   - Comprehensive user experience testing
   - Performance and usability validation
   - Final polish and optimization

### Following Phase 7 (Future Enhancements)
1. Advanced search filters (date, location, people)
2. Performance optimization and caching
3. Enhanced error handling and user feedback
4. Additional SmugMug integration features

## Technical Decisions Made
- **No frameworks policy**: Vanilla implementations only
- **File-based storage**: JSON files initially, avoid database complexity
- **Direct API calls**: No wrapper libraries for external services
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only add libraries when absolutely necessary
- **Test each feature**: Verify functionality before moving to next component

## Considerations
- Focus on getting basic structure working before adding complexity
- Prioritize testing and validation at each step
- Maintain documentation updates as development progresses
- Keep file structure as simple as possible initially
