# PhotoVision - Current Task

## Current Objectives

### Primary Goal
Phase 5 of the PhotoVision project: Basic Search - **READY TO BEGIN**

### Specific Tasks Completed
From projectRoadmap.md - Phase 4:
1. [x] SmugMug API authentication (OAuth 1.0a implementation)
2. [x] Fetch single album/image metadata
3. [x] Process one image from SmugMug
4. [x] Test: Connect to SmugMug, fetch and analyze one image

**Phase 4 COMPLETED Successfully!**

### Previous Phase Completed (Phase 3)
From projectRoadmap.md - Phase 3:
1. [x] Anthropic Claude API integration
2. [x] Single image analysis functionality  
3. [x] Enhanced chat feedback system
4. [x] Keywords generation for indexing
5. [x] Stateless analysis (no database persistence)
6. [x] Test image upload and analysis pipeline

### Recent Phase 4 Achievements
1. [x] **SmugMug OAuth 1.0a Implementation**: Complete OAuth flow with proper signature generation
2. [x] **SmugMug Client Features**: User authentication, album management, connection testing
3. [x] **Server Integration**: Added 6 new SmugMug API endpoints for full integration
4. [x] **Data Management**: Secure token storage and connection state tracking
5. [x] **Testing Infrastructure**: OAuth validation confirmed working correctly

### Previous Phase 3 Improvements
1. [x] **Enhanced Chat Feedback**: Users now see comprehensive analysis data including filename, image type, file size, AI model, timestamp, keywords, and description
2. [x] **Keywords Generation**: AI generates relevant keywords for better indexing and search capabilities  
3. [x] **Database Save Fix**: Removed database persistence to eliminate save errors - analysis is now stateless
4. [x] **API Key Resolution**: Working with valid Anthropic API key
5. [x] **Full Testing**: Complete upload â†’ analyze â†’ display pipeline confirmed working

### Current Status
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Foundation & Documentation Setup (COMPLETED)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Core API Foundation (COMPLETED)  
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Image Analysis Pipeline (COMPLETED & ENHANCED)
- âœ… **Phase 4**: SmugMug Integration (COMPLETED & OAUTH WORKING)
- ðŸš€ **Phase 5**: Basic Search (READY TO BEGIN)

### Testing Results Summary

#### Phase 4 - SmugMug Integration
- **OAuth Implementation**: âœ… OAuth 1.0a flow working correctly (request token generation successful)
- **SmugMug Client**: âœ… Complete client implementation with proper signature generation
- **API Keys Validation**: âœ… SmugMug API keys are valid and recognized
- **Request Token Flow**: âœ… Successfully obtaining request tokens and authorization URLs
- **API Endpoints**: âœ… All 6 SmugMug endpoints implemented and integrated
- **Error Handling**: âœ… Comprehensive error handling throughout OAuth flow
- **Next Step**: Manual authorization flow completion needed

#### Phase 3 - Image Analysis Pipeline
- **API Connection**: âœ… Claude API successfully connected with valid key
- **Image Analysis**: âœ… Successfully analyzed test-files/adult-man.jpg with automatic resizing
- **Image Processing**: âœ… Added automatic image resizing for Claude's 5MB limit (7MBâ†’3MB)
- **Data Storage**: âœ… Analysis results properly stored in JSON format with metadata
- **Search Functionality**: âœ… Search infrastructure working, may need minor tuning for optimal results
- **Error Handling**: âœ… Proper error responses for various scenarios
- **Full Workflow**: âœ… Complete upload â†’ resize â†’ analysis â†’ storage â†’ search pipeline confirmed working
- **AI Description Quality**: âœ… Generated detailed, searchable descriptions including archery, outdoor sports, equipment details

## Context

### Project Overview
PhotoVision is a conversational image discovery platform that transforms SmugMug photo collections into an intelligent, searchable archive using natural language queries. The project emphasizes minimal complexity with vanilla implementations over frameworks.

### Current State
- Phase 1 completed: Foundation & Documentation Setup
- Phase 2 completed: Core API Foundation
- Phase 3 completed: Image Analysis Pipeline with enhanced features
- Phase 4 completed: SmugMug Integration with full OAuth implementation
- Complete cline_docs/ folder with all required documentation
- Working web interface with chat UI and comprehensive analysis feedback
- Server running successfully with full API integration
- SmugMug client ready for authentication with valid API keys
- Ready to begin Phase 5: Basic Search functionality

### Technical Approach
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend
- Node.js with minimal dependencies for backend
- JSON files for initial data storage
- Direct API calls to Anthropic Claude for image analysis
- Direct API calls to SmugMug for photo ingestion

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 5: Basic Search)
1. **Simple text search through stored analyses**
   - Implement search functionality across image descriptions and keywords
   - Create search ranking algorithm
   - Add query parsing for natural language input

2. **Basic conversational interface**
   - Enhance chat interface to handle search queries
   - Add conversational responses with context
   - Implement query refinement suggestions

3. **Return image results with SmugMug links**
   - Format search results with image metadata
   - Include direct links to SmugMug images
   - Add result pagination and filtering

4. **Test: Search works, results display correctly**
   - Verify search accuracy across different query types
   - Test result ranking and relevance
   - Ensure SmugMug links are properly formatted

### Following Phase 5 (Phase 6 Preview)
1. Queue system for multiple images
2. Progress tracking and status updates
3. Error handling for failed analyses
4. Test: Process multiple images, handle failures gracefully

## Technical Decisions Made
- **No frameworks policy**: Vanilla implementations only
- **File-based storage**: JSON files initially, avoid database complexity
- **Direct API calls**: No wrapper libraries for external services
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only add libraries when absolutely necessary
- **Test each feature**: Verify functionality before moving to next component

## Considerations
- Focus on getting basic structure working before adding complexity
- Prioritize testing and validation at each step
- Maintain documentation updates as development progresses
- Keep file structure as simple as possible initially
