# PhotoVision - Current Task

## Current Objectives

### Primary Goal
Phase 3 of the PhotoVision project: Image Analysis Pipeline - **COMPLETED**

### Specific Tasks Completed
From projectRoadmap.md - Phase 3:
1. [x] Anthropic Claude API integration
2. [x] Single image analysis functionality
3. [x] Store analysis results in JSON format
4. [x] Test image upload and analysis pipeline

**Phase 3 COMPLETED Successfully!**

### Current Status
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Foundation & Documentation Setup (COMPLETED)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Core API Foundation (COMPLETED)  
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Image Analysis Pipeline (COMPLETED & FULLY TESTED)
- ðŸš€ **Phase 4**: SmugMug Integration (READY TO BEGIN)

### Testing Results Summary
- **API Connection**: âœ… Claude API successfully connected with valid key
- **Image Analysis**: âœ… Successfully analyzed test-files/adult-man.jpg with automatic resizing
- **Image Processing**: âœ… Added automatic image resizing for Claude's 5MB limit (7MBâ†’3MB)
- **Data Storage**: âœ… Analysis results properly stored in JSON format with metadata
- **Search Functionality**: âœ… Search infrastructure working, may need minor tuning for optimal results
- **Error Handling**: âœ… Proper error responses for various scenarios
- **Full Workflow**: âœ… Complete upload â†’ resize â†’ analysis â†’ storage â†’ search pipeline confirmed working
- **AI Description Quality**: âœ… Generated detailed, searchable descriptions including archery, outdoor sports, equipment details

## Context

### Project Overview
PhotoVision is a conversational image discovery platform that transforms SmugMug photo collections into an intelligent, searchable archive using natural language queries. The project emphasizes minimal complexity with vanilla implementations over frameworks.

### Current State
- Phase 1 completed: Foundation & Documentation Setup
- Complete cline_docs/ folder with all required documentation
- Basic project structure established (package.json, server.js, public/)
- Working web interface with chat UI
- Server running successfully on port 3001
- Ready to begin Phase 2: Core API Foundation

### Technical Approach
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend
- Node.js with minimal dependencies for backend
- JSON files for initial data storage
- Direct API calls to Anthropic Claude for image analysis
- Direct API calls to SmugMug for photo ingestion

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2 tasks)
1. **Enhance Node.js server with routing**
   - Add API endpoints for future functionality
   - Implement basic request/response handling
   - Add middleware for JSON parsing

2. **Implement JSON file-based data storage**
   - Create data management utilities
   - Set up file structure for storing image analyses
   - Add basic CRUD operations for JSON data

3. **Add error handling and logging**
   - Implement proper error responses
   - Add console logging for debugging
   - Create error handling middleware

4. **Test server endpoints**
   - Verify API endpoints respond correctly
   - Test JSON data operations
   - Ensure error handling works properly

### Following Phase 2 (Phase 3 Preview)
1. Integrate Anthropic Claude API for image analysis
2. Create single image analysis functionality
3. Store analysis results in JSON format
4. Test image upload and analysis pipeline

## Technical Decisions Made
- **No frameworks policy**: Vanilla implementations only
- **File-based storage**: JSON files initially, avoid database complexity
- **Direct API calls**: No wrapper libraries for external services
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only add libraries when absolutely necessary
- **Test each feature**: Verify functionality before moving to next component

## Considerations
- Focus on getting basic structure working before adding complexity
- Prioritize testing and validation at each step
- Maintain documentation updates as development progresses
- Keep file structure as simple as possible initially
