# PhotoVision - Technology Stack

## Core Technology Decisions

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for web interface
  - Justification: Standard, lightweight, no dependencies
  - Usage: Single-page interface with chat components
  
- **CSS3**: Vanilla styling with basic reset
  - Justification: No framework overhead, full control over styling
  - Usage: Minimal, clean interface design with responsive layout
  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, no frameworks
  - Justification: Avoid framework complexity, use browser APIs directly
  - Usage: Chat interface, API communication, UI interactions

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server
  - Justification: Unified language stack, good for I/O operations
  - Usage: API server, file operations, external API integration
  
- **Express.js**: Minimal web framework (only if needed)
  - Justification: Lightweight routing, minimal overhead
  - Usage: Basic HTTP routing and middleware

### Data Storage
- **JSON Files**: File-based data persistence
  - Justification: Simple, no database setup, easy to debug
  - Usage: Store image analyses, user data, application state
  - Migration path: Can move to SQLite later if needed

### External APIs
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Image analysis and description generation
  - Justification: Strong vision capabilities, good for detailed descriptions
  - Usage: Analyze images, generate searchable descriptions
  
- **SmugMug API**: Photo collection access
  - Justification: Direct integration with user's photo collections
  - Usage: Fetch images, metadata, album information
  - Authentication: OAuth 1.0a (IMPLEMENTED & WORKING)
  - Implementation: Complete OAuth flow with signature generation
  - Status: Fully functional with request token generation and access token exchange

### Development Tools
- **npm**: Package management (minimal dependencies)
  - Justification: Standard Node.js package manager
  - Usage: Manage essential dependencies only
  
- **Node.js built-in modules**: HTTP, filesystem, path operations
  - Justification: Avoid external dependencies where possible
  - Usage: Server operations, file handling, HTTP requests

## Architecture Decisions

### Application Structure
- **Single-page application**: All functionality on one page
  - Justification: Simple user experience, minimal complexity
  - Implementation: HTML + CSS + JavaScript served statically

### Data Flow
- **Request-response pattern**: Traditional HTTP communication
  - Justification: Simple, predictable, easy to debug
  - Implementation: Frontend → Node.js server → External APIs

### File Organization
- **Minimal structure**: Few files, clear separation of concerns
  - Justification: Easy to understand, maintain, and navigate
  - Structure: 
    ```
    /
    ├── server.js (main server)
    ├── public/ (static files)
    ├── data/ (JSON storage)
    ├── lib/ (utility modules)
    │   ├── claudeClient.js (AI integration)
    │   ├── smugmugClient.js (OAuth & API)
    │   └── dataManager.js (data operations)
    ├── cline_docs/ (documentation)
    └── userInstructions/ (user guides)
    ```

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Application continues with limited functionality
  - Justification: Better user experience during API failures
  - Implementation: Try-catch blocks, fallback responses

### Security Considerations
- **API key management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
  - Justification: Keep credentials secure, not in code
  - Implementation: .env file with API keys and secrets
  
- **OAuth token management**: Secure token storage and lifecycle management
  - Justification: Proper OAuth security and token refresh handling
  - Implementation: JSON-based token storage with expiration tracking
  - Security: Request tokens, access tokens, and secrets properly managed

- **Input validation**: Basic sanitization of user inputs
  - Justification: Prevent injection attacks, data corruption
  - Implementation: Simple validation functions

## Dependencies Strategy

### Minimal Dependencies Approach
- **Core principle**: Only add dependencies when absolutely necessary
- **Evaluation criteria**: Can this be implemented with built-in features?
- **Current dependencies**:
  - `dotenv` (for environment variables) - IMPLEMENTED
  - `express` (if needed for routing) - Using Node.js built-in HTTP currently
  - No other dependencies added - maintaining minimal approach

### Dependency Management
- **Version locking**: Exact versions to ensure consistency
- **Regular updates**: Monitor for security updates
- **Audit trail**: Document why each dependency was added

## Future Technology Considerations

### Scalability Options
- **Database migration**: JSON → SQLite → PostgreSQL path
- **Caching**: Simple in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **Rate limiting**: API call management for cost control

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading**: Load images and data as needed
- **Compression**: Gzip for static files
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery (future consideration)

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Console logging**: Simple debugging and monitoring
- **Error tracking**: Basic error logging to files
- **Performance metrics**: Response time tracking

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual testing**: Test each feature as it's built
- **Integration testing**: Test API connections and data flow
- **Browser testing**: Verify frontend functionality across browsers

### Code Quality
- **Simple patterns**: Clear, readable code over clever optimizations
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic
- **Consistent style**: Standard JavaScript formatting

## Technology Rationale Summary

The technology stack emphasizes simplicity, minimalism, and direct control over functionality. This approach:
- Reduces complexity and learning curve
- Minimizes external dependencies and potential failures
- Provides full control over performance and behavior
- Enables easy debugging and maintenance
- Allows for incremental complexity as needed

Each technology choice prioritizes getting working functionality quickly while maintaining the ability to understand and modify every aspect of the system.
