# PhotoVision - Concept Document

## Core Concept
A conversational image discovery platform that transforms your SmugMug photo collection into an intelligent, searchable archive using natural language.

## Overview
PhotoVision bridges the gap between traditional keyword search and conversational AI, allowing users to find images through natural language queries like "10 photos of young adults smiling" or more complex requests like "photos that feel nostalgic from summer evenings."

## Key Components

### 1. Image Ingestion & Processing Pipeline
- **SmugMug API Integration**: Automated fetching of images and existing metadata
- **Bulk Image Analysis**: Using vision LLMs (GPT-4 Vision, Claude, etc.) to analyze each image
- **Rich Description Generation**: Creating detailed, contextual descriptions for each image

### 2. Intelligent Cataloging System
- **Vector Database or Traditional Database**: For search capabilities

### 3. Conversational Search Interface
- **Natural Language Chat**: Intuitive conversational interface

## Expanded Feature Ideas

### Backend Services

1. **Ingestion Service**
   - Handles SmugMug API authentication and rate limiting
   - Queues images for processing
   - Manages incremental updates

2. **Analysis Service**
   - Manages LLM API interactions
   - Implements retry logic and error handling
   - Extracts structured data from LLM responses

### Data Schema Elements

- **Image Metadata**
  - Original SmugMug metadata
  - EXIF data (camera, settings, GPS)
  - File information

- **Generated Content**
  - description
  - tags

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Connect SmugMug account via OAuth
   - crawl albums/photos for import

2. **Processing Phase**
   - Real-time progress dashboard

3. **Result Interaction**
   - chat provides a list to the reference image on SmugMug

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Cost Management
- **Challenge**: LLM API calls for thousands of images can be expensive

- **Solutions**:
  - User-selectable processing levels

### Processing Time
- **Challenge**: Initial catalog creation could take hours/days

- **Solutions**:
  - Progressive processing with immediate searchability
  - Priority processing for recent/favorite images
  - Background processing with notifications
  - Distributed processing architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Decisions**
   - Choose primary programming language and framework
   - Select LLM provider(s) and vision models
   - Decide on database technologies
   - Plan deployment architecture

3. **Prototype Development**
   - Build proof of concept for image analysis
   - Test search accuracy with sample data
   - Create basic UI
   - Validate SmugMug API integration
   - Validate Anthropic API integration
