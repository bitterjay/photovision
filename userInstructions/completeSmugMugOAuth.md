# Complete SmugMug OAuth Authorization

## Current Status âœ…
Your SmugMug OAuth implementation is working correctly! The API keys are valid and request tokens are being generated successfully.

## Next Steps to Complete OAuth Flow

### Step 1: Manual Authorization (Required)
1. **Visit the Authorization URL**: 
   ```
   https://secure.smugmug.com/services/oauth/1.0a/authorize?oauth_token=9G4vJWx2M2QK726kSsWGTd8LhHfPvJSV&Access=Public&Permissions=Read
   ```
   *(Note: The token in the URL above is from the latest test - you'll get a new one each time you run the test)*

2. **Log into SmugMug**: Use your SmugMug account credentials

3. **Authorize the Application**: Click "Allow" to grant PhotoVision access to your photos

4. **Note the Verifier Code**: After authorization, you'll be redirected to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/smugmug/callback?oauth_token=TOKEN&oauth_verifier=VERIFIER_CODE
   ```
   Copy the `oauth_verifier` value from the URL

### Step 2: Get Fresh Authorization URL
Since OAuth tokens expire quickly (10 minutes), run the test again to get a fresh authorization URL:

```bash
node test-smugmug-connection.js
```

This will give you:
- A new request token
- A new authorization URL to visit
- Instructions for the next steps

### Step 3: Complete Access Token Exchange
Once you have the verifier code, we can complete the OAuth flow by exchanging it for permanent access tokens.

### Step 4: Test Full Integration
After getting access tokens, we can test:
- Fetching your SmugMug user information
- Accessing your photo albums
- Retrieving image metadata

## Why This Manual Step is Needed
OAuth 1.0a requires user consent for security. This one-time authorization will give PhotoVision permission to access your SmugMug photos for AI analysis and search functionality.

## Troubleshooting
- **Token Expired**: If you get an error, run `node test-smugmug-connection.js` again for a fresh token
- **Authorization Failed**: Ensure you're logged into SmugMug and click "Allow"
- **Callback Error**: The localhost callback is expected to fail since we don't have a server running on that endpoint yet

## Next Development Steps
After manual authorization works:
1. Implement automatic OAuth callback handling in the server
2. Add token storage and management
3. Build album and image fetching functionality
4. Integrate with the AI analysis pipeline
